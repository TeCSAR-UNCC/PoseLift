# PoseLift: Exploring Pose-Based Anomaly Detection for Retail Security: A Real-World Shoplifting Dataset and Benchmark
This directory contains the PoseLift dataset published in WACV 2025 conference.
## Overview
PoseLift is a dataset created specifically for detecting shoplifting behaviors using pose-based anomaly detection techniques. Built in collaboration with a retail store, PoseLift captures real-world shopping and shoplifting behaviors while addressing key challenges such as privacy concerns, data scarcity, and model biases. PoseLift dataset includes bounding box, person ID, and pose annotations, along with frame-level labels for shoplifting, categorizing all frames into two groups: normal behavior or shoplifting.
